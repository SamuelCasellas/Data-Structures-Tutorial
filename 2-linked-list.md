# Linked List

![A linked list has nodes each containing two references for the two nodes before and after it and its data. SOURCE: Wikimedia Commons](Picture_Files/Doubly_inked_list.png)


# Algorithm Efficiency

| Procedure | Linked List Algorithm Effeciency | Compared to List |
| --------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Add node to beginning | O(1) | O(n)
| Remove node at beginning | O(1) | O(n) |
| Add node in the middle
| Queue.length | `len(queue)` | O(n) |
