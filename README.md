# Welcome

Welcome to my tutorial on data structures in Python! Here you will be introduced to different data structures, learn of their purposes, and have the chance to code up your own implementations of them after seeing an example. But first, what exactly is a data structure?

# Definition of Data Structures

Data structures are well-defined classes, whether built-in or defined by the programmer, which hold data that can be used for solving a variety of real world problems. Each data structure varies in functionality, such as how the data is stored and retrieved. These classes can implement primitive data types that are already built in, such as lists and dictionaries, that are used in a very specific way to fulfill the purposes of the data structure they help compose. One example we will look at is the queue, which in Python uses a _list_.

These data structures also vary in performance times. This means that some data structures are able to retrieve data faster than other ones depending on how large the data set you are working with is. It is therefore wise to determine ahead of time what sort of data and how much you are working with. We will look into algorithm efficiency more in detail with each data structure.
